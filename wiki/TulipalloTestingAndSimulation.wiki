#summary How to perform user acceptance testing and simulation on the C++ Tulipallo Flight Controller Software for Raspberry Pi.

= Introduction =

Although designed for rockets, the Tulipallo Flight Controller is a suitable platform for the automated piloting of any hobby, nano, micro or medium sized flying vehicle. Our philosophy at Tulipallo.org is "little ups". If we can reasonable control an aircraft, we can move up to rockets, low earth orbit, deep space, etc...

Obviously, testing this at home is next to impossible with a real aircraft. To do this, Tulipallo.org has selected [http://www.x-plane.com X-Plane] as its simulation platform. This document provides details on how to set up X-Plane 10 and Tulipallo to test the flight control systems.
